# SpaceX-Flights
This React-based website is a virtual museum for all SpaceX flights. Users are able to view a variety of interesting information for each flight and view video footage, all provided by an unofficial SpaceX API.

## How to Use
You can visit the website here:

https://spacex-f.firebaseapp.com/

## Programming
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js

## Notes
API provided by the fine folks over at https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API.

In the near future I will improve the API call behavior of the app and make the dropdown selections dynamic.
